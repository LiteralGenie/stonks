Workflow
- (Transactions = deltas) are inputs
    - two types: 
        (1) tsns sourced from api
        (2) "generative" tsns inferred from insufficient funds (eg converting $10 -> ... when total of leaf nodes is <$10)

- then generate (Nodes = totals resulting from transactions)
    - if not generative tsn, the new node will be a child of some existing node
        - this facilitates future calculation of a cost basis
        - (so this creates multiple tree structures, with the root nodes being the result of gen-tsns)
    - it turns out to be simpler to assume (sum of children nodes) equals (parent node value)
      so create a child "remainder" node if necessary



Multiple Markets
- Nodes are generated from existing nodes in a FIFO manner. But this gets trickier if using multiple exchanges.
- Need to add and filter by Node.market attr

Transaction Order
- An implicit transaction order (going by the order they're inputted) won't cut it when converting to fiat.
  Since the conversion rate depends on a specific date, not just relative order.
- Need to add mandatory Node.date attr
- This seems misleading for generative tsns / remainder nodes
